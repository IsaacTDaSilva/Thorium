          Aside from Global health is greatly affected by the burning of fossil fuels, given enough 
          time, we will simply run out of accessible fossil fuels on this planet.
          According to ecotricity.co.uk, the world’s oil reserves will be depleted in 53 years 
          and natural gas in 52. Coal could last about 150 years.  We will soon see massive fuel
          shortages if we continue to rely on fossil fuels. Additionally, as these resources
          become increasingly depleted, it will become more and more expensive to extract them.

          Arguably the most convincing argument as to why we need to rapidly reform our
          energy sources is climate change. According to nasa.gov, carbon dioxide trapped in the
          atmosphere contributes to a “greenhouse effect”. This effect is creating a sort of 
          “blanket” around the globe which drastically alters the earth’s climate by keeping 
          heat from the sun in the atmosphere. The effects of this change could include major
          flooding, increased storms, droughts, ocean acidification, and extinctions.
