       What is Thorium

              Thorium energy is a type of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is generated by using
           radioactive material to convert water to steam. That steam then turns turbines which 
           generate electricity. In this whole process, little to no carbon dioxide is produced.
           Since nuclear power plants use a minable, storable material, as fuel, nuclear energy 
           is very reliable. Additionally, it is highly energy-efficient compared even to fossil 
           fuels.

	            One of the largest reasons that thorium energy has not been implemented is because
           of fear of nuclear power. After Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, public opinion of 
           nuclear power has become negative. While it is true that at the time nuclear power was
           somewhat dangerous, with modern technology nuclear energy is far safer than fossil fuels.
           Thorium is an especially safe fuel source, so much so that it would be virtually impossible
           for a thorium reactor meltdown to take place.
